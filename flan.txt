1. Prep – Because the caramel sets quickly, you want to have a 9″ x 2″ round cake pan out and ready for use. Also, preheat the oven to 350˚F and bring a kettle of water to boil.
2. Make the Caramel – In a saucepan, combine water and sugar and bring to a boil then reduce the heat to a simmer. As soon as it starts to change color, start swirling the pan. Once it’s the color of cinnamon, take it off the heat and swirl it for another 30 seconds.
3. Pour melted sugar into your cake pan and immediately tilt the pan to coat the bottom (be careful the pan will get hot!).
4. Make the Custard – Combine the custard ingredients in a blender and blend on low speed for 1 minute. Strain through a sieve lined with cheesecloth (to reduce the bubbles) and pour over your caramel layer.
5. Cover the cake pan with foil and set the pan inside of a large roasting pan then set the roasting pan in your oven. Pour hot water into the roasting pan, about halfway up the sides of the cake pan.
6. Bake at 350 for 70-80 minutes or until there is just a slight jiggle in the center. Remove from oven, uncover, transfer to a rack, and cool to room temperature then cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight.
7. To Serve – Run a knife around the edges of the cake pan. Set the cake on a rimmed platter and invert the cake onto the platter. Tap the cake pan until you feel it dislodging then lift the cake pan off the cake.
